# TRB-KM_Project
This project utilizes an Arduino UNO board using I2C interfacing and a BNO055 9DOF Fusion Absolute Orientation Breakout Board by Adafruit to measure parameters of compound weightlifting movements such as barbell path, barbell position, barbell velocity, and barbell acceleration.
I am a senior electro-mechanical engineering technology major at Penn State, and this project is a capstone project/start-up opportunity.
I am relatively inexperienced in both github and Arduino/I2C programming, and need assistance with the coding. If you stumble upon this project and are interested in helping, please do!
